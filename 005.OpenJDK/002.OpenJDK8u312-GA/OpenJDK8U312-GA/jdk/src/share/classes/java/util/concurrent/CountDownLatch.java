/**
 * A synchronization aid(援助) that allows one or more threads to wait until
 * a set of operations being performed in other threads completes.
 * >> 一种同步辅助，允许一个或多个线程等待，直到在其他线程中执行的一组操作完成。
 *
 * <p>A {@code CountDownLatch} is initialized with a given <em>count</em>.
 * The {@link #await await} methods block until the current count reaches
 * zero due to invocations of the {@link #countDown} method, after which
 * all waiting threads are released and any subsequent(后续) invocations of
 * {@link #await await} return immediately.  This is a one-shot(只有一次的) phenomenon(现象)
 * -- the count cannot be reset.  If you need a version that resets the
 * count, consider using a {@link CyclicBarrier}.
 * <p>
 * CountDownLatch 初始化时需要指定一个count，await方法会一直阻塞，直到count在调用countDown方法时被减到0。
 * 在所有的线程都释放之后，后续的await操作都会立即返回。即 CountDownLatch是一次性的——count不能被重置。
 * 如果你需要一个可以重置的版本，考虑使用CyclicBarrier
 *
 *
 * <p>A {@code CountDownLatch} is a versatile(多才多艺的，多功能的) synchronization tool
 * and can be used for a number of purposes(目的).  A
 * {@code CountDownLatch} initialized with a count of one serves as a
 * simple on/off latch(门闩), or gate(门): all threads invoking {@link #await await}
 * wait at the gate until it is opened by a thread invoking {@link
 * #countDown}(所有调用await的线程都在gate处等待，直到它被调用countDown的线程打开).
 * A {@code CountDownLatch} initialized to <em>N</em>
 * can be used to make one thread wait until <em>N</em> threads have
 * completed some action, or some action has been completed N times.
 *
 * <p>A useful property of a {@code CountDownLatch} is that it
 * doesn't require that threads calling {@code countDown} wait for
 * the count to reach zero before proceeding, it simply prevents any
 * thread from proceeding past an {@link #await await} until all
 * threads could pass.
 * <p>
 * 示例用法一： 所有线程同时启动，等待所有线程执行结束
 * <p><b>Sample usage:</b> Here is a pair of classes in which a group
 * of worker threads use two countdown latches:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The first is a start signal that prevents any worker from proceeding
 * until the driver is ready for them to proceed;
 * <li>The second is a completion signal that allows the driver to wait
 * until all workers have completed.
 * </ul>
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class Driver { // ...
 *   void main() throws InterruptedException {
 *     CountDownLatch startSignal = new CountDownLatch(1);
 *     CountDownLatch doneSignal = new CountDownLatch(N);
 *
 *     for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) // create and start threads
 *       new Thread(new Worker(startSignal, doneSignal)).start();
 *
 *     doSomethingElse();            // don't let run yet
 *     startSignal.countDown();      // let all threads proceed   // 所有线程同时开始
 *     doSomethingElse();
 *     doneSignal.await();           // wait for all to finish  // 所有线程都结束了，即结束提醒
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * class Worker implements Runnable {
 *   private final CountDownLatch startSignal;
 *   private final CountDownLatch doneSignal;
 *   Worker(CountDownLatch startSignal, CountDownLatch doneSignal) {
 *     this.startSignal = startSignal;
 *     this.doneSignal = doneSignal;
 *   }
 *   public void run() {
 *     try {
 *       startSignal.await();    // 等待开始信号
 *       doWork();
 *       doneSignal.countDown();  // 任务执行完成了
 *     } catch (InterruptedException ex) {} // return;
 *   }
 *
 *   void doWork() { ... }
 * }}</pre>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * 示例用法二: 将一个任务切割为N份，等待所有部分处理完成
 * <p>Another typical usage would be to divide a problem into N parts,
 * describe each part with a Runnable that executes that portion and
 * counts down on the latch, and queue all the Runnables to an
 * Executor.  When all sub-parts are complete, the coordinating thread
 * will be able to pass through await. (When threads must repeatedly
 * count down in this way, instead use a {@link CyclicBarrier}.)
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class Driver2 { // ...
 *   void main() throws InterruptedException {
 *     CountDownLatch doneSignal = new CountDownLatch(N);
 *     Executor e = ...
 *
 *     for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) // create and start threads
 *       e.execute(new WorkerRunnable(doneSignal, i));  // 提交到线程池中执行
 *
 *     doneSignal.await();           // wait for all to finish   等待所有的任务执行完成
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * class WorkerRunnable implements Runnable {
 *   private final CountDownLatch doneSignal;
 *   private final int i;
 *   WorkerRunnable(CountDownLatch doneSignal, int i) {
 *     this.doneSignal = doneSignal;
 *     this.i = i;
 *   }
 *   public void run() {
 *     try {
 *       doWork(i);
 *       doneSignal.countDown();
 *     } catch (InterruptedException ex) {} // return;
 *   }
 *
 *   void doWork() { ... }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * <p>Memory consistency effects: Until the count reaches
 * zero, actions in a thread prior to calling
 * {@code countDown()}
 * <a href="package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility"><i>happen-before</i></a>
 * actions following a successful return from a corresponding
 * {@code await()} in another thread.
